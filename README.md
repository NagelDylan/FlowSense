# FlowSense

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: React
- **Backend**: Django
- **Database**: PostgreSQL

## Project Overview
FlowSense is a revolutionary reading tool designed to assist users in digesting advanced reports and other dense texts using a sentence-based approach. Our goal is to make the reading experience more interactive, visual, and efficient, particularly for Gen Z users who often struggle with maintaining focus.

## Inspiration
During our internships, we frequently encountered complex reports filled with foreign concepts. As overstimulated Gen-Z members with short attention spans, concentrating without constant distractions was challenging and time-consuming. We identified two main problems:
1. **Tedious Definitions**: Obtaining definitions for unfamiliar terms is cumbersome and disruptive. Google searches lack context, and using tools like split screens with ChatGPT is slow and inefficient.
2. **Reading Progress**: It's hard to remember what has already been read and what hasn't, especially after taking breaks.

This inspired us to create FlowSense, a tool to enhance reading productivity by encouraging the use of keyboard shortcuts, allowing users to focus on the current sentence without distractions.

## Key Features
- **Text Highlighting**: Colorful progress indications help users quickly identify what they've read and their current reading position.
- **GPT-Based Explanations**: Contextual definitions and explanations are generated using ChatGPT, providing more relevant information than a standard search.
- **Progress Bar**: A visual indicator of reading progress.
- **Embedded Definitions**: Users can quickly recall meanings or abbreviations by embedding definitions within the text.
- **Annotations**: Users can insert their own notes, similar to Jupyter Notebook text blocks.

## Potential Additional Features
- **ML-Enhanced Vocabulary**: Use machine learning to pre-identify potentially difficult words.
- **Customization**: Options to change keybinds, colors, enable dark mode, and hide command displays.
- **Project Management**: Save and organize multiple reading projects, similar to Google Docs.
- **Multi-Sentence Selection**: Allow users to select and interact with multiple sentences at once.
- **Word Selection**: Enable selection and interaction with individual words.
- **Sentence-Based Navigation**: Users can progress through text one sentence at a time using keyboard shortcuts, keeping their focus intact.
- **Sentence Marking**: Users can highlight significant sentences in different colors for easy reference.
